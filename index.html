      <h1>&hearts; When Weenies Unite &hearts;</h1>

      <p>
        The moment I met you at STS9,
        <br />
        I had no freaking clue that one day you'd be mine.
        <br />
        <br />
        We knew we were crazy for getting involved,
        <br />
        But I was way too attracted to worry at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        It didn't take long before I was hooked,
        <br />
        There was no going back, I didn't even look.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are <em>sooooo</em> damn cute, the obsession is real, <br />I'll
        never stop craving the way you make me feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's been a wild ride but we've never been better,
        <br />
        I know one thing for sure, I want this <strong>forever.</strong>
