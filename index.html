      <p>
        The moment I met you at STS9,
        <br />
        I had no freaking clue that one day you'd be mine.
        <br />
        <br />
        We knew we were crazy for getting involved,
        <br />
        But the attraction was too strong to worry at all.

        It didn't take long before I was hooked,
        <br />
        There was no going back, I didn't even look.
        <br />
        You are <em>sooooo</em> damn cute, the obsession is real, I'll never
        stop craving the way you make me feel.

      <p>
        It's been one wild ride but we've never been better,
        <br />
        One thing is for sure, I want this forever.
